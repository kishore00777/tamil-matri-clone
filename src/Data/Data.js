Aravind's mother and sister showed her immense affection even when they first met. This display of warmth and care touched Kowsi deeply, and she was certain that her life with Aravind would be fulfilling",

For Kumaresh, his life completely changed after he met the love of his life - Tamilarasi.When asked about his journey before meeting Tamilarasi, Kumaresh says, I registered my profile on TamilMatrimony and opted for a premium membership. I got several recommendations from that portal that matched my requirements.",

Curious to know how this happened, I ask Manickam about the same, to which he says, “I met Mahalakshmi at a temple and got married to her within a week. It all started with a request from her when I was in Belgium. We both got talking and she expressed a liking for me.",

On the insistence of my mom I registered on the portal and I am so glad I did. When I came across Krishna’s profile, I found his description to be quite interesting. I installed the app and glanced through this profile again and sent him an interest. It was only after speaking to him that I felt he is the one for me. He completely changed my thoughts about marriage,” begins Mythili.",
